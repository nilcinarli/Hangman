Guess the word by letters so you don't get Sedat hung
The word to guess is "CAT," and you have three attempts to guess it.
You can enter a letter in the text field and press "Go" to make a guess.
If you guess a correct letter, it replaces the underscores in the word. If you guess the whole word correctly, it will reveal the word.
If you guess incorrectly, the attempts remaining will decrease.
When you run out of attempts, the game says "Sedat dies."
